# BLOG

Theme: https://github.com/bitbrain/jekyll-dash  

Changing from their early version which used plugins to non-plugins

I also deleted my old account. I am trying to find a alternative of GitHub Pages but failed.

I deleted two main tracking extensions, Google Analystics and Disqus. It may have something left in files, but it shouldn't able to send data.

Google Analystics is disabled, and Disqus was replaced by [giscus](https://github.com/giscus/giscus)
